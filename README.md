Clone of OlgahWolgah spotiload

aim: compile spotiload on Ubuntu 18.04

First, you need an api-key from spotify.

If you still do not have one: bad luck.
They do not give out anymore. But you could ask ..

Without api-key, you will not get it up and running.

You can not have mine - it's personal.
Do not even ask for it.


howto:

1. pull this repro
2. run the build.sh script
